Lucene Benchmark Contrib Change Log

The Benchmark contrib package contains code for benchmarking Lucene in a variety of ways.

$Id:$

9/9/08
 LUCENE-1243: Added new sorting benchmark capabilities.  Also Reopen and commit tasks.  (Mark Miller via Grant Ingersoll)

5/10/08
  LUCENE-1090: remove relative paths assumptions from benchmark code.
  Only build.xml was modified: work-dir definition must remain so  
  benchmark tests can run from both trunk-home and benchmark-home.  
  
3/9/08
  LUCENE-1209: Fixed DocMaker settings by round. Prior to this fix, DocMaker settings of 
  first round were used in all rounds.  (E.g. term vectors.)
  (Mark Miller via Doron Cohen) 

1/30/08
  LUCENE-1156: Fixed redirect problem in EnwikiDocMaker.  Refactored ExtractWikipedia to use EnwikiDocMaker.  Added property to EnwikiDocMaker to allow
  for skipping image only documents.

1/24/2008
  LUCENE-1136: add ability to not count sub-task doLogic increment
  
1/23/2008
  LUCENE-1129: ReadTask properly uses the traversalSize value
  LUCENE-1128: Added support for benchmarking the highlighter

01/20/08
  LUCENE-1139: various fixes
  - add merge.scheduler, merge.policy config properties
  - refactor Open/CreateIndexTask to share setting config on IndexWriter
  - added doc.reuse.fields=true|false for LineDocMaker
  - OptimizeTask now takes int param to call optimize(int maxNumSegments)
  - CloseIndexTask now takes bool param to call close(false) (abort running merges)


01/03/08
  LUCENE-1116: quality package improvements:
  - add MRR computation; 
  - allow control of max #queries to run;
  - verify log & report are flushed.
  - add TREC query reader for the 1MQ track.  
      
12/31/07
  LUCENE-1102: EnwikiDocMaker now indexes the docid field, so results might not be comparable with results prior to this change, although
  it is doubted that this one small field makes much difference.
  
12/13/07
  LUCENE-1086: DocMakers setup for the "docs.dir" property
  fixed to properly handle absolute paths. (Shai Erera via Doron Cohen)
  
9/18/07
  LUCENE-941: infinite loop for alg: {[AddDoc(4000)]: 4} : *
  ResetInputsTask fixed to work also after exhaustion.
  All Reset Tasks now subclas ResetInputsTask.

8/9/07
  LUCENE-971: Change enwiki tasks to a doc maker (extending
  LineDocMaker) that directly processes the Wikipedia XML and produces
  documents.  Intermediate files (one per document) are no longer
  created.

8/1/07
  LUCENE-967: Add "ReadTokensTask" to allow for benchmarking just tokenization.

7/27/07
  LUCENE-836: Add support for search quality benchmarking, running 
  a set of queries against a searcher, and, optionally produce a submission
  report, and, if query judgements are available, compute quality measures:
  recall, precision_at_N, average_precision, MAP. TREC specific Judge (based 
  on TREC QRels) and TREC Topics reader are included in o.a.l.benchmark.quality.trec
  but any other format of queries and judgements can be implemented and used.
  
7/24/07
  LUCENE-947: Add support for creating and index "one document per
  line" from a large text file, which reduces per-document overhead of
  opening a single file for each document.

6/30/07
  LUCENE-848: Added support for Wikipedia benchmarking.

6/25/07
- LUCENE-940: Multi-threaded issues fixed: SimpleDateFormat; logging for addDoc/deleteDoc tasks.
- LUCENE-945: tests fail to find data dirs. Added sys-prop benchmark.work.dir and cfg-prop work.dir.
(Doron Cohen)

4/17/07
- LUCENE-863: Deprecated StandardBenchmarker in favour of byTask code.
  (Otis Gospodnetic)

4/13/07

Better error handling and javadocs around "exhaustive" doc making.

3/25/07

LUCENE-849: 
1. which HTML Parser is used is configurable with html.parser property.
2. External classes added to classpath with -Dbenchmark.ext.classpath=path.
3. '*' as repeating number now means "exhaust doc maker - no repetitions".

3/22/07

-Moved withRetrieve() call out of the loop in ReadTask
-Added SearchTravRetLoadFieldSelectorTask to help benchmark some of the FieldSelector capabilities
-Added options to store content bytes on the Reuters Doc (and others, but Reuters is the only one w/ it enabled)

3/21/07

Tests (for benchmarking code correctness) were added - LUCENE-840.
To be invoked by "ant test" from contrib/benchmark. (Doron Cohen)

3/19/07

1. Introduced an AbstractQueryMaker to hold common QueryMaker code. (GSI)
2. Added traversalSize parameter to SearchTravRetTask and SearchTravTask.  Changed SearchTravRetTask to extend SearchTravTask. (GSI)
3. Added FileBasedQueryMaker to run queries from a File or resource. (GSI)
4. Modified query-maker generation for read related tasks to make further read tasks addition simpler and safer. (DC)
5. Changed Taks' setParams() to throw UnsupportedOperationException if that task does not suppot command line param. (DC)
6. Improved javadoc to specify all properties command line params currently supported. (DC)
7. Refactored ReportTasks so that it is easy/possible now to create new report tasks. (DC)

01/09/07

1. Committed Doron Cohen's benchmarking contribution, which provides an easily expandable task based approach to benchmarking.  See the javadocs for information. (Doron Cohen via Grant Ingersoll)

2. Added this file.

3. 2/11/07: LUCENE-790 and 788:  Fixed Locale issue with date formatter. Fixed some minor issues with benchmarking by task.  Added a dependency
 on the Lucene demo to the build classpath.  (Doron Cohen, Grant Ingersoll)

4. 2/13/07: LUCENE-801: build.xml now builds Lucene core and Demo first and has classpath dependencies on the output of that build.  (Doron Cohen, Grant Ingersoll)
